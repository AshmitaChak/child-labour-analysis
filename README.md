# 📊 Child Labour: Global Patterns & Disparities
## Overview

This project presents an exploratory analysis of global child labour patterns using international statistics. The analysis focuses on identifying long-term trends, geographic concentration, and gender-based disparities in child labour participation.

The workflow combines Python-based data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Tableau-based visual storytelling, with the goal of producing clear, insight-driven visual narratives.

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. How has child labour prevalence changed over time across world regions?

2. Which countries contribute the most to child labour within different age groups?

3. Where are gender disparities in child labour participation the largest?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: pandas, matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook: data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

Tableau: visual analytics and story-based dashboards

GitHub: version control and project documentation

## 📊 Key Insights

Child labour prevalence has declined across most regions over time, though the pace and magnitude of progress vary significantly by region.

A small number of countries account for a disproportionate share of children engaged in labour, with patterns differing by age group.

Gender disparities persist across many countries, with boys generally exhibiting higher child labour participation rates than girls.

## 🌐 Tableau Visualizations

This project was designed to be published as an interactive Tableau Public Story integrating all three research questions.

⚠️ Note on Tableau Public Availability
At the time of publication, Tableau Public server issues (HTTP 500 errors) prevented successful hosting of the interactive story. As a temporary measure, static screenshots of the Tableau stories have been included in the tableau/ folder to document the final visual outputs and narrative structure.

Once Tableau Public access is restored, the interactive story will be published and the link will be added here.
